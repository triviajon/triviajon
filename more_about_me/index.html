        <h1> <i>more</i> about me. </h1>
        <h3> committee of math majors </h3>
        <p> I was a member of the <b>Committee of Math Majors</b> (<a href="http://comm.mit.edu/">CoMM</a>).
        The CoMM is a small, selective group of mathematics undergraduates who dedicate their time to collecting data and 
        creating actionables to improve the math department at MIT. This includes coordinating with faculty members to improve the
        advising process for both students and faculty advisors. I had multiple focuses: at one point, it was on running multiple discussion forums
        with faculty and students, where we discussed community building and academics within the department. Later, I worked on
        maintaining the <a href="http://course18.guide/">Mathematics Underground Guide</a>. </p>

        <h3> asymptones acapella </h3>
        <p> I spent most of my free time doing music related stuff. I served as Musical Director for the <b>Asymptones</b>
        <a href="http://asymptones.mit.edu/">acapella group</a> (Spring 2023, Fall 2023). 
        I also served as publicity chair (Spring 2024), assistant musical director (Spring 2022, Fall 2022), social chair (Fall 2022), and wrote (or helped) several arrangements:</p>

        </ul>

        <h3> work </h3>
        <p> I also have a good amount of work experience, in case that's what you're here for. Most recently, I've completed an internship
        at <b>Amazon</b> where I developed a new major version of an incredible piece of software used for orchestrating machine learning experimentation workflows. 
        I can't give much details outside of what's on my resume due to a high level of confidentiality. Before that, I did research at
        <b>NASA JPL</b>. Resulting publications can be found in the <a href="/content/extras/">Extras</a> page.

        <h3> theatre </h3>
        <p> I'm am currently a member of the <b>Musical Theatre Guild</b> (<a href="https://mtg.mit.edu/">MTG</a>) and participate in productions
        as much as I can. I've been on the executive board for several semesters now. I'm responsible for many changes, including the new website and new membership structure. 
        My full production history with MTG can be found <a href="https://mtg.mit.edu/person/1/">here</a>, but some of the positions I'm most proud of are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> "Charles J. Guiteau" and Assistant Lights Designer in <a href="https://mtg.mit.edu/184/">Assassins</a> </li>
            <li> "Mitch Mahoney / Dan Dad / Olive's Dad" and Producer in <a href="https://mtg.mit.edu/183/">Spelling Bee</a> </li>
            <li> "Amos Hart" and Assistant Producer in <a href="https://mtg.mit.edu/2/">Chicago</a> </li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <p> In Spring 2024, I was the vocal director for Next Act's (<a href="http://nextact.mit.edu/">NACT</a>) production of Legally Blonde, a new and very challenging, but fun role.  
        Before that in Spring 2023, I acted in NACT's production of Remembering Her (2023), an original jukebox musical written by a fellow <a href="https://www.alanzhu.me/mit">MIT student, Alan Zhu</a>. </p>

        <p> In Fall 2023, I became a member of Life On Stage Theatre (<a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/group/life_on_stage_theatre">LOST</a>) by acting in Stupid F*cking Bird.
            A very positive review of the show has since been <a href="https://thetech.com/2023/12/14/theater-stupid">published by The Tech</a>. </p>

        <p> I've also worked with the Shakespeare Ensemble (<a href="https://ensemble.mit.edu/">Ensemble</a>) before as a video editor for their virtual production of Timon of Athens (2021). </p>

        <h3> rocket team </h3>
        <p> I was a member of the <b>Rocket Team</b> structuresâ„¢ subteam (<a href="https://rocketry.mit.edu/">rt</a>) and part of executive as infrastructure (IT) chair.
        I made drawings of structures cad parts in SolidWorks and additionally machined those parts in machine
        shops on campus. I also made contributions to the rocket team wiki for the conservation of knowledge
        between generations of rocket team. </p>

        <h3> other </h3>
        <p>I also enjoy watching musicals, following DCI, and playing Minecraft and Tetris. 
        Feel to contact me if you're interested in talking about any of my interests! </p>
        
        <p> I also like to publish a snippet of my music taste. Check out the playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Hs8wy9wArSIarx7rx38oK?si=0caf183f2ce4467b"> here. </a></p>
