        <h1> Hello. I'm Jon Rosario. </h1>
        <h4 class="indent2"> and I'm trying something  <i> <a href="/content/explain/index.html"> different. </a> </i> </h4>
        <p> Welcome to my new website. You can find shortcuts to all the important stuff about me in the links section. </p>
        <h2> About me. </h2>
        <p> I am a student at MIT (class of 2024) who is pursuing a double major in <b>Mathematics</b> and <b> Computer Science and Engineering</b> (18 and 6-3).
        I also have a concentration in <b>Music</b>. 
        My general academic interests include many aspects of computational mathematics such as complexity theory, algorithms, machine learning, and quantum computation/information theory. </p>

        <p>If you're interested in any of my past or present projects (academic or personal), you can check out my GitHub page. 
        My GitHub is a bit barren, since I don't usually upload projects unless someone wants to check out something. </p>
            
        <h2> Even <i>More</i> About Me. </h2>
        <p> I am a member of the <b>Committe of Math Majors</b> (<a href="http://comm.mit.edu/">CoMM</a>).
        The CoMM is a small, selective group of mathematics undergraduates who dedicate their time to collecting data and 
        creating actionables to improve the math department at MIT. This includes coordinating with faculty members to improve the
        advising process for both students and faculty advisors. Previously, my focus was on running multiple discussion forums
        with faculty and students, where we discussed community building and academics within the department. This semester, I worked on
        maintaining the <a href="http://course18.guide/">Mathematics Underground Guide</a>. </p>

        <p> I spend most of my free time doing music related stuff. I was a Musical Director for the <b>Asymptones</b>
        <a href="http://asymptones.mit.edu/">acapella group</a> for a year. I previously held assistant musical director and social chair positions.
        I also do a lot of arranging for 1-, 4-, and 6-part acapella. I'm working on a solution for sharing my many arrangements online
        without having to use the MuseScore website. </p>

        <p> I also have a good amount of job experience, in case that's what you're here for. Most recently, I've completed an internship
        at <b>Amazon</b> where I worked on an incredible piece of software used for orchestrating machine learning experimentation workflows. 
        I can't give much details outside of what's on my resume due to a high level of confidentiality. Before that, I did research at
        <b>NASA JPL</b>. Resulting <b>publications</b>:
        <div id='list'>
            <p>1. <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFM.G41A..08S/abstract">OPERA RTC Product, Algorithm, and Validation Approach</a></p>
            <p>2. <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10281744">Assessment of Terrain Dependence of Radiometric Terrain Corrected C-Band Sentinel-1 SAR Backscatter over Different Target Types</a></p>
        </div>

        <p> I'm also a member of the <b>Musical Theatre Guild</b> (<a href="https://mtg.mit.edu/">MTG</a>) and participate in productions
        as much as I can. Currently, I'm the assistant producer for Chicago (2024) and Member at Large for the group. I was also officially 
        involved with Heathers (2023) and Pippin (2022). </p>
        
        <p> I've also worked with the Shakespeare Ensemble (<a href="https://ensemble.mit.edu/">Ensemble</a>) before as a video editor for their virtual production of Timon of Athens (2021). </p>
        
        <p> In Spring 2023, I acted in Next Act's (<a href="http://nextact.mit.edu/">NACT</a>) production
	    of Remembering Her (2023), an original jukebox musical written by a fellow MIT student. </p>

        <p> In Fall 2023, I became a member of Life On Stage Theatre (<a href="https://calendar.mit.edu/group/life_on_stage_theatre">LOST</a>) by acting in Stupid F*cking Bird.
        A very positive review of the show has since been <a href="https://thetech.com/2023/12/14/theater-stupid">published by The Tech</a>. </p>

        <p> I was a member of the <b>Rocket Team</b> structuresâ„¢ subteam (<a href="https://rocketry.mit.edu/">rt</a>) and part of executive as infrastructure (IT) chair.
        Last year, I made drawings of structures cad parts in solidworks and additionally machined those parts in machine
        shops on campus. I also made contributions to the rocket team wiki for the conservation of knowledge
        between generations of rocket team. </p>


        <p>I also enjoy watching musicals, following DCI, and playing rhythm games and Tetris. 
        Feel to contact me if you're interested in talking about any of my interests! </p>
        
        <p> I also like to publish a snippet of my music taste. Check out the playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Hs8wy9wArSIarx7rx38oK?si=0caf183f2ce4467b"> here. </a></p>
