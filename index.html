        <h1> Hello. I'm Jon Rosario. </h1>
        <h4 class="indent2"> and I'm trying something  <i> <a href="/content/explain/index.html"> different. </a> </i> </h4>
        <p> Welcome to my new website. You can find shortcuts to all the important stuff about me in the links section. </p>
        <h2> About me. </h2>
        <p> I am a student at MIT (class of 2024) who is pursuing a double major in <b>Mathematics</b> and <b> Computer Science and Engineering</b> (18 and 6-3).
        I also have a concentration in <b>Music</b>. 
        My general academic interests include many aspects of computational mathematics such as machine learning, algorithms, complexity theory, and quantum computation/information theory.  </p>

        <p>If you're interested in any of my past or present projects (academic or personal), you can check out my GitHub page. 
        My GitHub is a bit barren, since I don't usually upload projects unless someone wants to check out something. </p>
            
        <h2> Even <i>More</i> About Me. </h2>
        <p> I am a member of the <b>Committe of Math Majors</b> (<a href="http://comm.mit.edu/">CoMM</a>).
        The CoMM is a small, selective group of mathematics undergraduates who dedicate their time to collecting data and 
        creating actionables to improve the math department at MIT. This includes hosting the 
        <a href="http://course18.guide/">Mathematics Underground Guide</a> and coordinating with faculty members to improve the
        advising process for both students and faculty advisors. Last semester, my focus was on running multiple discussion forums
        with faculty and students, where we discussed community building and academics within the department. </p>

        <p> I spend most of my free time doing music related stuff. I'm a Musical Director for the <b>Asymptones</b>
        <a href="http://asymptones.mit.edu/">acapella group</a>. I previously held assistant musical director and social chair positions.
        I also do a lot of arranging for 1-, 4-, and 6-part acapella. I'm working on a solution for sharing my many arrangements online
        without having to use the MuseScore website. </p>

        <p> I also have a good amount of job experience, in case that's what you're here for. Most recently, I've completed an internship
        at Amazon where I worked on an incredible piece of software used for orchestrating machine learning experimentation workflows. 
        I can't give much details outside of what's on my resume due to a high level of confidentiality. Before that, I did research at
        NASA JPL. A <a href="https://2023.ieeeigarss.org/view_paper.php?PaperNum=5789">presentation</a> of my work was given by my mentor 
        at the IGARSS conference in July 2023, but you may need an account to access the paper. You can also read <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AGUFM.G41A..08S/abstract">
        related work</a> where I am listed as a co-author at the Harvard Astrophysics Data System.</p>

        <p> I'm also a member of the <b>Musical Theatre Guild</b> (<a href="https://mtg.mit.edu/">MTG</a>) and participate in productions
        as much as I can. I was officially involved with Heathers (2023) and Pippin (2022). I've also worked with the Shakespeare 
        Ensemble before as a video editor for their virtual production of Timon of Athens (2021). Most recently I acted in <b><a href="http://nextact.mit.edu/">Next Act's</a></b> production
	    of Remembering Her (2023), an original jukebox musical written by a fellow MIT student. </p>

        <p> I was a member of the <b>Rocket Team</b> structuresâ„¢ subteam (<a href="https://rocketry.mit.edu/">rt</a>) and part of executive as infrastructure (IT) chair.
        Last year, I made drawings of structures cad parts in solidworks and additionally machined those parts in machine
        shops on campus. I also made contributions to the rocket team wiki for the conservation of knowledge
        between generations of rocket team. </p>


        <p>I also enjoy watching musicals, following DCI, and playing rhythm games and Tetris. 
        Feel to contact me if you're interested in talking about any of my interests! </p>
        
        <p> I also like to publish a snippet of my music taste. Check out the playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Hs8wy9wArSIarx7rx38oK?si=0caf183f2ce4467b"> here. </a></p>
