        <h1> Why? </h1>
        <h3> I've decided that over the top and unreadable websites are too annoying for the end user. </h3>
        <p> On top of that, they're just way too hard to maintain. If you're interested in a cool website with a custom 
            cursor, parallex effects, and self-made icons, I've <a href="/old.html"> done that before, and you can check
            it out here. </a> To me, it's just <b> not worth the effort. </b> </p>
        <p> When I wanted to add a new section to my website, I was considering redesigning the entire site until the thought
            hit me: <i> why </i> do I need to redesign my entire website for one additional page? </p>
        <p> Even in "simpler" websites, it can just be a pain to read for some users, especially those with accessibility issues. 
	    A big part of my personal philosophy is that knowledge should be accessible to all. Why wouldn't I extend philosophy this to my website? </p>
        <h3> Hopefully, I won't be redesigning this website any time soon. </h3>
        <p> Here's a cool gif of animated 8-bit stars.</p>
