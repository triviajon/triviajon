        <h3> Discord Bot Update -- Jonbot </h3>
        <h4> January 5, 2022 </h4>
        <p> Back in April, I decided to make my first bot on Discord, the popular messaging app. 
            Since then, I have upgraded it into a full fledged Discord bot with features comparable 
            to those run by longtime developers. Developed in Python, it includes a leveling system 
            and leaderboards, a database for storage of "lore" messages and image attachments, 
            games, and several fun features. </p>
        <img src="/content/journal/entries/files/jonbot_features.png">
        <p> The most innovative feature I'd like to talk about is the implementation of the "lore".
            My group of friends have lots of shared stories and wanted a centralized database of these stories. 
            By using the *lore command, users can add their stories and image attachments to the database. 
            Images are hashed using the following algorithm: </p>
        <img src="/content/journal/entries/files/image_hashing_algo.png">
        <p> Thus, users and make lookups using any similar looking image. 
            In fact, images are compared using the bitwise difference of the hashes of the image derivatives,
            users can even make "stickfigure" drawings from memory and return the proper lore lookup with good accuracy!
            More info can be found on my Github. Thanks for reading!
