        <h3> DRP Presentation </h3>
        <h4> February 5, 2022 </h4>
        <p> Throughout the month of January, I met multiple times per week with a small group of undergraduate/graduate students
            to present our readings into something called the Probabilistically Checkable Proofs Theorem (or PCP Theorem for short).
            We carefully read through many sets of lecture notes, mostly from Thomas Vidick's class on the quantum PCP conjecture. 
            Our readings included both the proven theorem in the classical setting and the conjecture in the quantum setting. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The PCP Theorem has many implications and applications in the computer science industry. Most notably, they give 
            us answers on how easy/hard it is to approximate solutions to certain problems, which is particularly important in industry.
        </p>
        <p> My partner and I gave a very nontechnical presentation at the conclusion of the program to get others interested in
            learning about the PCP theorem. The slides are available <a href="/content/journal/entries/files/Classical and Quantum PCPs.pdf">here</a>. </p>
