        <h3> Second time producing an acapella recording! </h3>
        <p> My opinion is that this turned out really well! I was musical director at the time of recording. This time around, we had
            learned from our recording of Reflection, so we applied the following changes: 
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li> Record people individually, using a higher quality setup. We didn't have access to a recording studio,
                    so we used a practice room on campus with an AT2020 + audio interface, with a pop filter and wind screen. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Record multiple takes of each person to splice them together for the best take of each person possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Work with FL Studio instead of Audacity, which gave us access to better plugins and a much easier workflow.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            I was primarily responsible for the production, but recieved a good amount of help from Silu Shen. 
            The arrangement itself was a collaboration effort between Kelly Hong and I. The sheet music can be found <a href="LLY.pdf">here</a>.
