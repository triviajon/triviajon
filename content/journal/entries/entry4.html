        <h3> April Fool's Day "resrever" Discord Bot </h3>
        <h4> April 1, 2021 </h4>
        <p> For April Fool's Day, I coded a Discord bot that would reverse any message sent to it automatically. </p>

        <p> My home friends and I communicate with each other via Discord, an instant messaging platform with 
            numerous capabilities. My friends decided it would be a funny and harmless prank if we only spoke 
            in "reverse talk" for the entire day. An example is shown here: </p>

        <p> Reading this proved to be quite a pain, so after class I decided to give myself 
            some time to get a bot running that would effectively reverse any message sent and send 
            the translated version back. Using the <a href='https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/'>discord.py API wrapper</a>,
            this proved to be a super easy task! My bot, resrever, reverses exactly
            what is asked of it in O(n) time, which is the best case possible. The bot can be called 
            in the Discord application by starting a message with the prefix "*reverse". An example is shown here: </p>
        <img src="/content/journal/entries/files/entry_4_reversed.png">
        <p> Right now, the bot runs off of my computer. I have a Raspberry Pi Zero W that I plan to host this on soon.
            Actually, I have plans to make a full featured Discord bot with interesting features!
            That's to come though. Thanks for reading! </p>
