        <h3> Unique Numbers Algorithm [WIP] </h3>
        <h4> April 6, 2021 </h4>
        <p> I worked on writing an algorithm that would generate a set of positive integers {n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, ..., n<sub>k</sub>}
            that would satisfy follow criteria: </p>
        <p class="indent"> 1. n<sub>i</sub> > n<sub>i-1</sub> </p>
        <p class="indent"> 2. Each number n<sub>i</sub> is not repeated in the set </p>
        <p class="indent"> 3. Each number n<sub>i</sub> cannot be recreated by summing any combination  
            of the previous numbers {n<sub>1</sub>, n<sub>2</sub>, ..., n<sub>k</sub>} </p>
        <p> An example of such a set of numbers is {1, 2, 4}. Each sequential number is increasing, 
            there are no repeats, and you cannot make a number from summation of the previous numbers 
            in the set (4 is not equal to 2+1). </p>

        <p> In reality, the reason for this was mostly curiousity resulting from social media. 
            On social media, there a popular game where people will give a list of actions, 
            and for each that you have (or haven't) done, you will add a point value to your "score".
            A player will post their resulting score, but others will not know which actions gave them points. 
            Example is shown below: </p>

        <img src="/content/journal/entries/files/never_have_i_ever.png">

        <p> I was interested in whether there is a set of point values you can associate to each action, 
            and thus be able to figure out exactly what actions a player picked. I split the problem into three parts: </p>

        <p class="indent"> 1. Writing up a way to check if a single number could be made from ANY possible sum of a list of integers </p>
        <p class="indent"> 2. Checking if a set of integers satisfied the above condition for every sequential number and it's subset of integers preceding it in the original set.   </p>
        <p class="indent"> Easily generating a list of random numbers satisifying these conditions </p>
        
        <p> Today, I did the first two using these two functions. o_check corresponds to 1.
            It returns a list of possible ways to add up to a given number "points" given a 
            dictionary of actions mapped onto point values {str:int}. is_unique_map corresponds to 2.
            It returns a boolean value (True = dictionary satisfies conditions/ False = fails conditions), 
            and a list of combinations that would cause in_unique_map to return a False using o_check. </p>
        <img src="/content/journal/entries/files/ocheck_and_isuniquemap.png">
        <p> I still haven't gotten to the third part, but that's because I want to figure out an efficient method 
            of generating numbers that isn't too intensive. </p>

        <p> That's all for now, thanks for reading!</p>
